# Problem
### Middlemen
Intermediaries are meant to help businesses facilitate transactions, but multiple middlemen can do more harm than the value they add. are all about coordination and agreement facilitation. Profits are already marginal for small to med businesses, but subscription and transaction fees eat away the hard work businesses owners face every day to keep their businesses alive and running well.
How could it be possible to remove these revenue-diverting facilitators?
By replacing it with programmable, self-executing agreements, you can operate a business the way  

### Oracle Challenge
The Oracle problem encapsulates a critical dilemma. While smart contracts excel in executing predetermined logic on the blockchain, they are inherently isolated from real-world events and external data sources. This creates a formidable obstacle for their practical application in scenarios that demand interaction with real-world variables.

Smart contracts, while efficient in digital spaces, grapple with a fundamental limitation when dealing with real-world events. This "Oracle challenge" refers to the difficulty of connecting smart contracts to trustworthy external data sources in order to make informed decisions based on real-world occurrences.

The Oracle problem refers to the challenge of seamlessly integrating real-world data into smart contracts on a blockchain, ensuring secure, trustworthy, and timely execution while maintaining the decentralized ethos.
